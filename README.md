# Spring 2024 Research

I began by researching the classification of graphs that yield linear edge ideals. I found the following useful result:

For any graph G, G has linear edge ideals IFF G's complement is chordal.

Chordal here means that every cycle of 4 of more vertices has a chord, which is an edge (not part of the cycle) connecting two vertices in the cycle.
